            Tame Impala emerged in 2007 as a home-recording project created by
            Parker, who posted a number of tracks on Myspace. This generated
            interest from a number of labels, and eventually he signed a
            worldwide deal with the independent Modular Recordings in July
            2008.To transfer these recordings to a live setting, Parker enlisted
            the help of Dominic Simper (bass) and Jay Watson (drums), and they
            began playing at local gigs.Kevin Parker came up with the name of
            the band as a reflection of the music's theme. He felt the name
            encapsulated a balance between untamed creativity and refined
            artistry.

            accidentally made it available for purchase on 12 May. The album was

            acclaim. Pitchfork named it Best New Music

            In an interview with Triple J talking about the album's nomination
            for the J Award, Parker stated that they had secretly been recording
            a new album. "Jay and I have been recording pretty compulsively and
            album number two is nearing potential completion already and I'm so
            excited about it that I'm having trouble keeping myself from telling
            you all about it". This came only months after Innerspeaker was
            released.

            on 13 May 2010 as the opening act for MGMT's 2010 American tour. The
            band returned to Australia to play at Splendour in the Grass
            festival, which was followed by a European Tour in July (including
            an appearance at the Reading Festival) and a national Australian
            tour in October. In November they returned to the UK and Europe for

            Pizzorno, Noel Fielding, Alexa Chung and Alison Mosshart, the band
            then went on to the United States and Canada for twenty headline
            dates including sold-out shows in Toronto, New York, Los Angeles,

            Tame Impala's second album, <b>Lonerism</b> , was released in 2012
            and was mixed by Dave Fridmann.Parker said that Lonerism "represents
            a departure from his previous work by incorporating an expanded
            sonic palette, more emotional song writing, and a more pronounced
            narrative perspective". It was created in a similar set up as
            Innerspeaker, whereby Parker wrote and recorded the majority of the
            album by himself at his home in Perth, Western Australia.Parts of
            the recording also occurred in Parker's home studio in France.
